# "make test" runs a test suite, which works fine on a development
# environment, but not on the autobuilders.  To get it to work on the
# autobuilders requires a few tweaks, as of 2.2.1:

# - The upstream tarball does not contain /t/magit-tests.el; for
#   convenience this is included in
#   debian/patch/*-upstream-repo-files.patch

# - The testing routines require git to be installed, so you need a
#   build dependency on git

# - There is one more mysterious error with a non-ASCII filename that
#   occurs only in a minimal chroot environment
