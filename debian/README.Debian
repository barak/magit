magit for Debian
================

Colors used by magit are invisible?
-----------------------------------

Emacs has probably failed to detect that your background is
black. This is an issue especially with KDE konsole (see upstream bug
121). You can work around this by adding

(custom-set-variables '(frame-background-mode 'dark))
 
to ~/.emacs or by using M-x customize-variable RET
frame-background-mode RET.
